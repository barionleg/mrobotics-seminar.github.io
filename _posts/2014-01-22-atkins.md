Abstract:
--------
Robotic vehicles are now able to plan and autonomously execute task-level actions as well as optimizing and precisely following safe and efficient trajectories. Automation has, however, struggled to effectively manage off-nominal situations, a particularly important capability when such events introduce risk of losing a costly vehicle or of bringing harm to people or property.  This presentation will describe Dr. Atkinsâ€™ long-term research in improving safety and robustness through autonomous identification and mitigation of risk using flight safety assessment and management (FSAM) coupled with emergency or adaptive flight planning (AFP).  Simulation-based case studies inspired by aircraft accidents will be presented.   Experimental research based on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (MAAV) quadrotor and the Autonomous Aerospace Systems (A2Sys) lab's aerobatic unmanned aircraft will be presented, illustrating two complementary efforts to reduce risk and expand autonomous operational capabilities.
