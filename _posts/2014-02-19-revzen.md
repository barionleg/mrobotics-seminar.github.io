Abstract:
--------
Historically, robots were used in controlled environments for high-performance manufacturing tasks -- putting an emphasis on careful design. In this talk, I will discuss the other extreme of design requirements -- how can we build robots to face unknown challenges? 

A particular focus on space exploration and other exploratory activities will lead us to discuss how involved humans need to be in the manufacture of the robot, on an axis between "self reproducing" robots and robot kits for manual assembly. I will present some examples of ongoing work on rapid robot prototyping.
